/*Using the Dist function from the task Func59, write a function
Alts(xA, yA, xB, yB, xC, yC) that evaluates and returns the altitudes hA, hB, hC
drawn from the vertices A, B, C of a triangle ABC (the coordinates of vertices
are input real-valued parameters). Using this function, evaluate the altitudes of
each of triangles ABC, ABD, ACD provided that the coordinates of points A, B,
C, D are given. */
